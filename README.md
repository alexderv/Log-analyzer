# Log-analyzer
A lightweight Python CLI tool for analyzing system and authentication logs.   It parses log files, detects suspicious patterns like failed logins and brute-force bursts, and generates structured CSV and HTML reports for easy review.  This project was built as a hands-on exercise in log parsing, pattern detection, and automated reporting.
